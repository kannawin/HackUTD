This is a live chat app in the same vein of an IRC chatroom combined with a drawing board.
You set your username and type your message to anyone in the chatroom.
If you feel the need to draw you can as well and it will get updated live.

Currently if you want to test the functionality of it, start the app and run two instances of it. Use the features of the app and observe that the same happens on the other window at the same time.
